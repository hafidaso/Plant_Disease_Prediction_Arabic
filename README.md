# Plant Disease Prediction Using TensorFlow and Streamlit - Arabic

This project provides a web-based interface for predicting plant diseases using a pre-trained TensorFlow model. The application is built with Streamlit and predicts the disease in plants based on an image input. The model identifies various diseases for different plants such as apples, cherries, corn, and more.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload an image of a plant's leaf for disease detection.
- **Disease Prediction**: The TensorFlow model predicts the plant disease and provides a confidence score.
- **Disease Descriptions**: The application includes descriptions of the diseases and suggested treatments for each identified disease.

## Demo

To see the application in action, follow the instructions below to run it locally.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-prediction.git
   cd plant-disease-prediction

### Running the Application

To run the Streamlit application, use the following command:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
